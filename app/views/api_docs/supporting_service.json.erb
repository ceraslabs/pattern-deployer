Therefore, the concept of supporting service is introduced to describe the deployment of additional component(s). E.g. In order to setup openvpn network of topology, we need to setup a certificate authority to generate keys/certificates. Only admin can enable/disable supporting services. Once a supporting service is enabled, it can be shared by all topologies.<h4>Supporting services</h4><table><thead><tr><th>supporting service</th><th>description</th></tr></thead><tr><td>host_protection</td><td>Provide host-based intrusion protection service. If enable, nodes in topology can be monitored by an ossec server to detect any potential intrusion</td></tr><tr><td>openvpn</td><td>Provide openvpn service. Specifically, enabling this service will deploy an server which dedicates to generate keys/certificates for message encryption. User can enable this service if communications between nodes need to be secured</td></tr><tr><td>dns</td><td>Provide load-balancing DNS service. If enable, nodes can subscribe itself as members of DNS. The load-balancing DNS will dispatch requests to its member(s) according to certain load-balancing scenario.</td></tr></table>"
